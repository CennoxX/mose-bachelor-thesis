LoRa and LoRaWAN were released as a radio communication technology to the public in 2015 by Semtech. 
Very early on it already received coverage in scientific media as it was introduced as a
promising long-range radio communication technology for IoT devices @vangelista_long-range_2015.

This section presents relevant literature correlating with mobile RSSI-based LoRa Localization.

== LoRa Localization
There a multiple approaches for localization in RF based communication networks. The most commonly
used all depend on one or more of four physical metrics of the received radio signal. These properties
are the angle of arrival (AoA), time of arrival (ToA), Time delay of arrival (TDoA) and received signal strength
(RSSI) @marquez_understanding_2023.

Localization systems which are based on the angle of arrival use a directed antenna array to measure the
angle at which the radio signal was received. When the exact distances between two anchor nodes are known, the position
of a third node, further called end node, can be estimated simply on basis of the SAS congruence theorem.
A slight variation of this method can be used when the distances between the anchor nodes is unknown. In this
case the AoA of at least three anchor nodes must be known. The position of the end node can now be estimated by
projecting lines from each anchor node with the measured AoA. The intersection of the lines represents the point or area
in which the end node must be located. The projected lines only intersect in a single point when the AoA measurements
are perfect i.e. the measurement has no error attached.

Many different applications for LoRa/LoRaWAN were evaluated since its release. Because of the scope
of this thesis this section only covers previous work which include some kind of localization with LoRa.
The following section should not be regarded as a comprehensive list of all work including LoRa localization
concepts but rather be used as a short overview of different applications for which LoRa localization
was evaluated prior to this thesis.

Fargas et al. evaluate LoRa for use in an alternative GPS-free geolocation system @fargas_gps-free_2017.
Their proposed approach for localization with LoRa signals is based on precise measurements of the
Time of Arrival (ToA) of one packet at multiple LoRa gateways (anchor node). They then calculate the time difference of
the different ToA timestamps and estimate the distance between the end node and each gateway by using the
propagation velocity of radio waves, which is the speed of light. These distance are then combined by a
multilateration algorithm to estimate the position of the end node.

)

Fargas et al. also showed in their work, that by using the Generalized ESD test for detecting and eliminating outliers in
the distance measurement data they could improve the accuracy of the position estimation.

At last they shortly compared the current consumption of their test system with a GPS + GSM based device and found that their
device had significant lower current consumption and therefore could drastically decrease the power requirements for
devices with localization systems.


This idea is further advanced in @mackey_lora-based_2019 where they evaluate LoRa as alternative localization system
to GPS for Emergency Services. 

They found that simple off-the-shelf LoRa hardware could be used for achieving 
a positioning error between $9 - #qty("20", "meter")$ in an area of $#qty("200", "meter")$ x $#qty("120", "meter")$.

They also estimated the expected battery-life both of the transmitter and the receiver node and found that the transmitter
would possibly run up to 200 hours on a 5000 mAh battery but the receiver would only last about 90 hours with one battery charge.

Another point Fargas et al. highlight is the importance of a method for detecting and removing outliers in the RSSI measurement.
They show the difference 

In @dieng_outdoor_2019 they use RSSI-based LoRa Localization to track individual animals of a cattle herd to better deal with livestock theft.
Their solution is based on a hybrid localization approach where they use both GPS and LoRa RSSI measurements to estimate the positions of the
individual animals. They both deploy hybrid nodes, nodes equipped with both LoRa and GPS, and LoRa-only nodes. The hybrid nodes are used to
continuously improve the RSSI-distance model over time by correlating their GPS position with the current distance estimated by the RSSI-distance
model. Through this mechanism

    - insufficient accuracy for range of applications
    - often need pre-trained models
  - RSSI => signal-strength approach
