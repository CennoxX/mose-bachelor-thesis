- IoT with LoRa @vangelista_long-range_2015
- importance of localization in IoT implementations @shit_location_2018

LoRa provides excellent communication range at low power consumption but does this by
only providing very slow data rates up to a theoretical limit of 11 kbps @rizzi_using_2017.
Due to this limitation many applications for which LoRa was evaluated in involve a low- or
ultra-low-power sensor IoT device which has only small data packets which need to be transferred
to a centralized control system or storage server. In @rizzi_using_2017 a proposal is made for
utilizing LoRa and LoRaWAN technology for providing wireless local networks for communication of
sensors and actuators in an Industry 4.0 scenario. Other work evaluates LoRa in concrete real-time
scenarios. In @priyanta_evaluation_2019 they evaluate LoRa as a communication technology for vehicle
and asset tracking data at the harbor. In @alves_introducing_2020 they evaluate the achievable coverage in a smart campus setting.
And in @sciullo_design_2020
