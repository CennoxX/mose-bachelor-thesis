*** Using LoRa for industrial wireless networks
+ calculation of maximum possible simultaneous connections in LoRaWAN
*** Evaluation of LoRa Technology for Vehicle and Asset Tracking in Smart Harbors
+ transmission of GNSS data via LoRa
+ deployment test in harbor with 1000 nodes in 2500m area around 1 gateway
+ LoRa as durable wireless communication system - harbor is a harsh environment for
  RF wireless communication due to it being composed of mostly metal structures

*** LoRa-based Localization System for Emergency Services in GPS-less Environments
+ LoRa Localization as alternative to GPS in extreme environments (underwater, underground) for emergency services

* Principals
** Distance estimation
** Location estimation
** Power consumption
** Accuracy
** Public adoption
*** Introducing a survey methodology for assessing LoRaWAN coverage in Smart Campus scenarios
+ LoRaWAN as distributed Mesh? network within a smart campus
+ new methodology for testing coverage
+ demonstrates effectiveness of introduced methodology in a real smart campus
* Implementation
* Evaluation
* Future works
