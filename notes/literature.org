* Findings
+ TDoA (Time-Delay of Arrival) with Multilateration is good locating method, because only Gateways must be time-synchronized to each other
+ Triangulation doesn't need perfect time-synchronization
** Technology
+ AD8302 phase detector module
+ Lora/GPS Shield SX1276/SX1278 (Dragino LoRa?)
+ STM32WLEx MCU with LoRa support
+ WuLoRa Sensor Node
  - based on MSP430FR5969
  - LoRa Semtech SX-1276 radio module
+ RTK module uBlox NEO-M8P-2
+ Waspmote
+ Murata Electronics CMWX1ZZABZ-078
+ Murata Electronics CMWX1ZZABZ-093

* GPS-free Geolocation using LoRa in Low-Power WANs, 2017, Fargas & Petersen
+ Multilateration with TDoA
+ data filtering to remove outliers
