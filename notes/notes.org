* Distance measurement
** Via RSSI
*** Antenna gain
*** Path-Loss-Model
+ RSSI = K - 10y log_10(d/d_0)
+ measure d_0 at 1m
+ multiple measurements to calculate path loss exponent

  + multiple rssi measurements at different distances
  + https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/lora-location-tracker-part-6-calculation
    + distance = 10^((RSSI - RSSI_0)/(20a))
    + a and RSSI_0 a determined by measurement
*** Multilateration
+ solve for x,y,z of LoRa-Tag
