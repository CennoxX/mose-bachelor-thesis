* Error Budget
+ Best possible accuracy because of time base (32 MHz): +-9.375m.
+ Error per diverging timer tick: 9.375m.
+ => PLL could be used to obtain 48 MHz (maximum clock speed for timer) from HSE
** Maybe use external clock source with higher frequency

* Calibration procedure
** Reset device
+ is startup time of STM32WL55 fixed?
  - no => wait on calibration trigger
** Start TIM2 after fixed amount of clock cycles
+ TIM2 counts every clock tick from HSE (clocked at 32MHz)
  => minimum time step: 1s / (32 * 10^6) = 31.25ns


* Distance measurement via RSSI
** Path-Loss-Model
+ RSSI = K - 10y log_10(d/d_0)
+ measure d_0 at 1m
+ multiple measurements to calculate path loss exponent

  + multiple rssi measurements at different distances
  + https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/lora-location-tracker-part-6-calculation
    + distance = 10^((RSSI - RSSI_0)/(20a))
    + a and RSSI_0 a determined by measurement
** Multilateration
+ solve for x,y,z of LoRa-Tag
